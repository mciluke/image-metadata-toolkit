# Image Metadata Toolkit
Image metadata is text information pertaining to an image file that is embedded into the file. Image metadata includes details relevant to the image itself as well as information about its production.

Image Metadata Toolkit is a web app made with MongoDB, Express, React, Node and [piexifjs](https://github.com/hMatoba/piexifjs) that allows users to upload JPEG/JPG photos and modify the metadata embedded within them.
